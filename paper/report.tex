\section{Introduction}

\section{Data}
 The original audio description was in German, so we first used Google Translate 
 to convert from German to English. Due to grammatical differences, we decided to
 only keep nouns and verbs, and discarded the adjectives and other words including
 stopwords. Princeton University provides a list of stopwords for text preprocessing.
 Stopwords are the most commonly used natural language words in the English, but have 
 very little meaning. Examples of stop words include "and", "to", and "him". We saved 
 the translated text into a CSV file and parsed in Python.

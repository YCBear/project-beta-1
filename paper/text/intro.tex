\par \indent Dustin E. Stansbur's article "Natural Scene Statistics Account for the Representation of 
Scene Categories in Human Visual Cortex" describes the method by which the human brain 
aggregrate information about subjects to represent scene categories. Using statical learning 
methods, researchers can learn categories of certain objects, and model fMRI brain signals 
when human subjects are viewed images of scenes using the learned categories. In our study,

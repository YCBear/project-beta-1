\par \indent Dustin E. Stansbury's article "Natural Scene Statistics Account for the Representation of 
Scene Categories in Human Visual Cortex" describes the method by which the human brain 
aggregate information about subjects to represent scene categories. Using statistical learning 
methods, researchers can learn categories of certain objects, and model fMRI brain signals 
when human subjects are viewed images of scenes using the learned categories. In our study, 
instead of images of scenes, we have audio descriptions of the scenes that are presented to 
human subjects. However, we hypothesize that the response would still stimulate different parts of the brain which can be modeled. We attempt to decode fMRI data by first taking the voxel responses and fit using a regression model to find decoder weights and then predict category probabilities. Categories can determined through WordNet, which classifies words based on hierarchical similarities. It groups English words into sets of synonyms called synsets, provides short definitions and usage examples, and records the number of relations among these synonym sets or their members (Wikipedia).

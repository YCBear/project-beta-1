There are places where we expected errors to be introduce to the project. For example, we use Google translate to conver the german description into English without supervising, which might induce random errors into the design matrix. And since not all words in the description has an one to one correspondence in WordNet, we took out some words in the process of generating the design matrix.

Furthermore, because the movie description we obtained from openfmri.org is not detailedly mark with each TR. It is not able for us to infer what words are said to the subjects inside a specific TR. We have to infer that brain activity are activated by the whole sentence within a certain time window instead of by each single words at a single time point.

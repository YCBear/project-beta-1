\par We attempt to find correlations between brain activity through fMRI scans and emotions 
or actions occuring in the movie. The data provided includes a detailed transcript of 
the movie divided by scenes. This process involves NLP (Natural Language Processing) of 
the script using text-sentiment/n-gram analysis of the script to determine the "emotional 
distribution" of each scene. After training a linear regression model based on multiple 
scsene/ fMRI pairs, we will predict how people are feeling or actions that are occuring

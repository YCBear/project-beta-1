#Need to add functions/find modules to support these on our data 

#bootstrap, bagging

#classification - kmeans, random-forest, (multinomial/dirchlet dist in paper)

#using wordnet to find categories?
#tests to evaluate our classification/model (need to find a way to evaluate the
#peformance of our classification - feed it new list of words to 'true' categories and
#compare with predicted categories), secomd test:
#see if our predicted classifications are stat sig - null is uniform dist of correctly guessing 
#what true cat. was of what person was seeing i.e. given brain scan Xi, this does not give map  
#to what person was watching at that moment, alt. Xi gives us information of the category  

 going to cat, alt. is

#non-paramatric tests - permutation test, Mahn Whitney, Wilcox text, 

#parametric tests - ztest, t-test, LRT, 

#regression - convolusion, GLM

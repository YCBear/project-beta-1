The study in "Natural Scene Statistics Account for the Representation of 
Scene Categories in Human Visual Cortex"\cite{stansbury2013neuron} analyzed 
fMRI scans in response subjects watching movies as a visual stimulus.
The study created 'scene' definitions consisting of the objects in the scene
by visually analyzing the movie, and then attempted to determine correlations
between areas of the brain and objects/scenes. The data included spans the
fMRI scans of around twenty patients,d

For our project, we plan to perform an analogous study, attempting to find
correlations between brain activity inferred through fMRI scans and emotions.
The data provided includes a detailed transcript of the movie, divided by 
scenes, so this process includes a text-sentiment analysis of the script, 
and determining an 'emotional distribution' of each scene. After training a 
model based on multiple scene/fMRI pairs, we hope to be able to predict
how people are feeling based on fMRI scans and the active areas of the brain
during that period.

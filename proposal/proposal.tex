The study in "Natural Scene Statistics Account for the Representation of 
Scene Categories in Human Visual Cortex"\cite{stansbury2013neuron} analyzed 
fMRI scans in response to subjects watching movies as a visual stimulus.
The study created 'scene' definitions consisting of a list of objects in 
a setting by visually analyzing the movie, and then attempted to determine 
correlations between areas of brain activity and objects/scenes. The data 
included spans the fMRI scans of around twenty patients taken throughout
the movie, as well as questionnaires they were asked to fill out prior
to the experiement, and demographic information on all patients.

For our project, we plan to perform an analogous study, attempting to find
correlations between brain activity (inferred through fMRI scans) and 
emotions or actions occurring in the movie.The data provided includes 
a detailed transcript of the movie, divided by scenes, so this process 
involves NLP of the script using text-sentiment/n-gram analysis of the 
script, and determining an'emotional distribution' of each scene. After 
training a linear regression model based on multiple scene/fMRI pairs, we 
hope to be able to predict how people are feeling or actions that are 
occurring based on fMRI scans and the active areas of the brain during that 
period.
